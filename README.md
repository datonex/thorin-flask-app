## UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### User Stories

- #### Things are slowly getting back to normal due to the pandemic, I want to plan my next holiday

1. I want to easily navigate the site relatively easily

2. I want to be able to see a balance of text, images and some video to get a glimpse of where I will be visiting

3. I want to be able to access links that direct me to important websites easily

4. I want some clicking interaction with the page so that I don't get bored

- #### As a previous who is using the website for reference

1. I want to have access to the website on any device and on the go

2. I want the navigation bar easily accessible so that I can get where I want quickly

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

Initially the colour scheme of the website was supposed to represent the national colours of the zimbabwean flag. However the colours were too bright and did not blend well together.

Instead, I used the idea that Zimbabwe has a lot of wild life, the colour was meant to mimic the savannah during a sunset. The colour is subtle without grabbing to much attention while giving more focus to the images. The main colour was picked using the colour picker on the header website to obtain the colour light salmon (#fdcba6) The buttons were matched using the compound approach from [adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel). to obtain the colour (#71C9A2)

#### Typography

- Font used for headings was Lobster with a back-up font of sans-serif. The font is eye catching and decorated white still easy to read.

<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/lobster-font.png" height="50px" />

- Font used for main text was Open Sans with a back-up font of sans-serif. The font is easy to read and well spaced out.

<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/open-sans-font.png" height="50px"/>

#### Imagery

- Images on the website were the top if not second priority on the website. They needed to supplement the text and offer visual aid to illustrate favourable tourist locations.

#### Mockups/wireframes

Mockups were made using Balsamiq Wireframes

[Mockup](./assets/planning/mockup-1.pdf)

- Wireframes were created using Adobe Xd, however, the layout and design was fallowed very loosely and changed during the mockup stage.

- #### Mockups

  - Mockups were also created using Adobe Xd and the final design of the webpage is very closely related hence I haven't included any screenshots.

### Existing Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

#### Common Features Across All Pages

- [x] **Header** - allows user to easily navigate across all pages

- Header is fixed to top of page for easy access (desktop and large tablets)
- Zimbabwe logo and text are positioned on the left and are links that take you to the homepage
- Navigation is place on the right on the logo for easy access (under logo for mobile)
- Navigation links change colour when hovered over. This lets the visitor know that it is clickable.
- Navigation link is underlined to let user know what page they are on
- Entire header disappears for mobile devices
- Colors have been chosen with optimum contrast in mind to be pleasant to the eye.
- [x] **Links** that are hovered over
- All links that are surrounding text have been underlined and change color when hovered over. This helps the user to identify external links. (except logo)
- [x] **Navigation banner**
- Navigation banner is the same across all pages to give uniformity and familiarity
- background image on home is scrollable to give a more fun user experience
- [x] **Accessibility**
- All images have aria labels in case they don't load and for the visually impaired
- [x] **Buttons**
- All buttons have the same styling and they invert colours when hovered (except for scroll to top button)
- [x] **Responsiveness**
- All pages work well with many screen sizes
- [x] **Footer**
- Footer sticks to the bottom of the page, regardless of the amount of content. This aids the overall user experience.
- All content have near uniform layout to give a nice and engaging flow of text and images
- Social links have been grouped together
- 'Contact us' is form for feedback and any question the user might have

### Specific to Pages

- [x] **Home Page**

- Image grid to easily see a handful of places the user can visit. When the mouse hovers you get addition information about the location

### Features Left to Implement

- Add a page where you can make a booking for a particular destinations. this includes adding a virtual online basket so that users can see what they have already selected (requires **Javascript** knowledge) For this reason I decided to remove the booking page from the website because it would be too incomplete and not provide a positive user experience.

- hide the scroll to top button at the beginning of page

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:

- Go to the "Contact Us" page
- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

- ### Navigation bar

- When the logo or 'Zimbabwe' text is clicked, the user is redirected to the home page
- All links are working and have been tested.
- navigation bar is aligned vertically and under the logo for screens smaller than 660px
- The navigation bar stays at the top of the page for screens larger than 660px only

- ### Footer

- ### The Image grid

- Any image that is hovered on (desktop only) the text is uniformly aligned and shows correct information for another device the grid is hidden and a continuous prose is displayed instead.

- ### External links

- Links to external websites, the booking and visa button bring the user to the right website in a new tab.

- ### Internal Links

- Logo and text all lead to home page
